"Notes"
"January 2019 income limits reflect Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)-converted income standards and include a disregard equal to five percentage points of the federal poverty level (FPL) applied at the highest income level for Medicaid and separate CHIP coverage. Eligibility levels are reported as percentage of the FPL. The 2019 FPL for a family of three was $21,330."

"States may use Title XXI CHIP funds to cover children through CHIP-funded Medicaid expansion programs and/or separate child health insurance programs for children not eligible for Medicaid. Use of Title XXI CHIP funds is limited to uninsured children. The Medicaid income eligibility levels listed indicate thresholds for children covered with Title XIX Medicaid funds and uninsured children covered with Title XXI funds through CHIP-funded Medicaid expansion programs. To be eligible in the infant category, a child has not yet reached his or her first birthday; to be eligible in the 1-5 category, the child is age one or older, but has not yet reached his or her sixth birthday; and to be eligible in the 6-18 category, the child is age six or older, but has not yet reached his or her 19th birthday. "
""
"The states noted use federal CHIP funds to operate separate child health insurance programs for children not eligible for Medicaid. Such programs may either provide benefits similar to Medicaid or a somewhat more limited benefit package. They also may impose premiums or other cost sharing obligations on some or all families with eligible children. These programs typically provide coverage for uninsured children until the child’s 19th birthday. "

"Since 2000, the Kaiser Family Foundation's Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured has issued regular updates examining changes and trends in the eligibility rules, enrollment and renewal procedures and cost-sharing practices in Medicaid and CHIP. Those reports are compiled here: [Annual Reports on Eligibility Rules, Enrollment and Renewal Procedures, and Cost-Sharing Practices in Medicaid and CHIP](http://www.kff.org/medicaid/report/annual-updates-on-eligibility-rules-enrollment-and/). To access all available years of data, see [Trends in Medicaid Income Eligibility Limits](http://kff.org/data-collection/trends-in-medicaid-income-eligibility-limits/)."

Footnotes
"1. Median value for the United States. Medians for CHIP-funded uninsured children are based on the upper limit of coverage."
"2. Alabama, the District of Columbia, Oklahoma, and Tennessee have different lower bounds for adolescents in Title XXI funded Medicaid expansions depending on age. The lower bound for Title XXI funded Medicaid is 18% for children ages 14 through 18 in Alabama, 63% for children ages 15 through 18 in the District of Columbia, 69% for children ages 14 through 18 in Oklahoma, and 29% for children ages 14 through 18 in Tennessee."
"3. In California, children with higher incomes are eligible for separate CHIP coverage in certain counties."
"4. In Florida, all infants are covered in Medicaid. Florida operates three separate CHIP programs: Healthy Kids covers children ages 5 through 18; MediKids covers children ages 1 through 4; and the Children's Medical Services Managed Care Plan serves children with special health care needs from birth through age 18. In Florida, families can buy-in to Healthy Kids for children ages 5-19 and to MediKids children ages 1 to 4."
"5. Indiana uses a state-specific income disregard that is equal to five percent of the highest income eligibility threshold for the group."
"6. In Kansas, eligibility for children in the separate CHIP program is a dollar-based income level equal to 238% FPL in 2008. This amount increased in 2014 for the MAGI conversion, but as a fixed dollar amount, the equivalent FPL level may erode over time."
"7. Massachusetts also covers insured children in its separate CHIP program with Title XIX Medicaid funds under its Section 1115 waiver. Massachusetts also covers uninsured 18-year-olds with incomes up to 150% FPL under its Medicaid expansion."
"8. Michigan also provides CHIP-funded Medicaid expansion coverage to children with incomes between 212% FPL to 400% FPL affected by the Flint water crisis."
"9. In Minnesota, the infant category under Title XIX-funded Medicaid includes insured and uninsured children up to age two with incomes up to 275% FPL"
"10. In North Carolina, all children ages 0 through 5 are covered in Medicaid while the separate CHIP program covers children ages 6 through 18 with incomes above Medicaid limits."
"11. Oklahoma offers a premium assistance program to children ages 0 through 18 with income up to 222% FPL with access to employer sponsore insurance through its Insure Oklahoma program."
"12. In Tennessee, Title XXI funds are used for two programs, TennCare Standard and CoverKids (a separate CHIP program). TennCare Standard provides Medicaid coverage to uninsured children who lose eligibility under TennCare (Medicaid), have no access to insurance, and have a family income below 216% FPL or are medically eligible."
"13. In Wisconsin, children are not eligible for CHIP if they have access to health insurance coverage through a job where the employer covers at least 80% of the cost."
