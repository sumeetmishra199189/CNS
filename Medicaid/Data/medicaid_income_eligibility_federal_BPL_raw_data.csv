"Notes"
"January 2019 income limits reflect Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)-converted income standards, and include a disregard equal to five percentage points of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) applied to the highest income limit for the group. In some states, eligibility limits for Section 1931 parents are based on a dollar threshold. The values listed represent the truncated FPL equivalents calculated from these dollar limits."

"Per CMS guidance, there is no deadline for states to implement the Medicaid expansion. For more information, please see: [Status of State Action on the Medicaid Expansion Decision](http://kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/state-activity-around-expanding-medicaid-under-the-affordable-care-act/)."
