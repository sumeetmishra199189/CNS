"Notes"
"January 2019 income limits reflect Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)-converted income standards and include a disregard equal to five percentage points of the federal poverty level (FPL) applied at the highest income level for Medicaid and separate CHIP coverage. Eligibility levels are reported as percentage of the FPL. The 2019 FPL for a family of three was $21,330."

"*CHIP*: This column indicates whether the state has adopted the option to cover otherwise eligible children of state employees in a separate CHIP program. Under the option, states may receive federal funding to extend CHIP eligibility where the state has maintained its contribution levels for health coverage for employees with dependent coverage or where it can demonstrate that the state employees’ out-of-pocket health care costs pose a financial hardship for families."

"*Unborn Child Option (CHIP-Funded)*: The unborn child option permits states to consider the fetus a ""targeted low-income child"" for purposes of CHIP coverage."
